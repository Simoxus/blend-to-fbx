# Blend to FBX Batch Converter
Simple little batch and python combo that's really simple to use :)
The batchfile also features the option to either export in Unity's FBX or the more widely used FBX, made by Autodesk.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

Changing the name of the Python file may stop the Batchfile from working.
